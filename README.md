# WasmEdge for Go Package

The [WasmEdge](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge) is a high performance WebAssembly runtime optimized for server side applications. This project provides a [golang](https://golang.org/) package for accessing to WasmEdge.

* For a complete tutorial, please read the article [Extend Your Golang App with Embedded WebAssembly Functions in WasmEdge](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/extend-golang-app-with-webassembly-rust/), which demonstrates how to embed a Wasm function and how to embed a full Wasm program from the Golang app.

For the developers need the `WasmEdge-TensorFlow` or `WasmEdge-Image` plug-ins for `WasmEdge-go`, please install the `WasmEdge` with the corresponding plug-ins:

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install.sh | bash -s -- --plugins wasmedge_tensorflow wasmedge_tensorflowlite wasmedge_image -v 0.13.5
```
